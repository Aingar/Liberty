The plan is to meet on Freeport 7 tomorrow to seal the deal on the ore shipment. If everything works out they'll owe me a million credits. It's the deal of a lifetime.\n \nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I did the deal. I'm now the proud owner of over a ton of Boron. I put all my savings into this deal. It's not entirely legal, but here in the Borderworlds, nobody really pays too much attention to this. I've been in contact with a man named Lonnigan, apparently a hired gun representing Samura Heavy Industries. He says his clients might be interested in the shipment.\n \nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt's been six weeks since my last entry. Unfortunately, I couldn't find out anything about alien ruins or uncharted systems. Very frustrating. The only thing I've heard was that there's been sightings of strange ships out near Sigma 17. Who knows. The good news is that I've managed to hook up with a captain of a Republican Shipping convoy. He's transporting a large shipment of Boron from Mainz to Honshu, but wants to keep the profits for himself. We agreed to meet on Kurile tomorrow. We'll see, maybe luck is on my side this time.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nAfter two weeks of travel, I finally managed to get to the Sigma system cluster. The trip through the Independent Worlds turned out to be much more dangerous than I thought. I was lucky several times that police patrols happened to be in the area when pirates wanted to blast me out of the stars. Anyway, word has it that there are a number of uncharted systems in this area of space. I will try to find out more information.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nI've finally decided to leave Bretonia and to try my luck in the Borderworlds. Despite what Tobias says, I can't sit around Leeds for the rest of my life and fix up other people's ships while more and more alien ruins are being discovered. They say that only 11 percent of the Borderworlds have been charted yet and hundreds of unknown planets are awaiting discovery. I'm starting this personal Neural Net Log to keep track of my travels and adventures."

From the time the alert started, we only had a few moments before the station blew up. Hundreds of people weren't so lucky. I actually had to carry Lonnigan to the life pod because a bulkhead collapsed during the attack and hit him in the head. He’s been unconscious ever since. The medics assure me that he'll recover. I certainly hope so. We're currently on a rescue ship en route to Manhattan but things aren't looking so good. I lost my ship and my ore shipment blew up with the rest of the station. All I have left is 500 credits. That wouldn't even buy me a ticket back to Leeds on a waste disposal freighter."

The other eight survivors simply wouldn't stop talking about what had happened on Freeport 7. Speculations were running wild, and just about everybody was accused at one point or another. Some were convinced Chancellor Niemann was behind the attack, and others accused Governor Tekagi. A Kruger rep assured me that Samura was the only possible group that had an interest in destroying Freeport 7. After a whole lot of useless debate, the majority seemed to agree in the end that The Order was behind it. Anyway, I have to say Manhattan is everything that Tobias made it out to be: a single giant city that covers almost the entire planet. They say that over 220 million people live here -- unbelievable. The medics just took Lonnigan to intensive care in Medical. They said it’ll take a while until he’s released. No matter how long it takes, I'll stay in Manhattan until he recovers. After all, we had signed the deal already. In the meantime, I should find a job. My 500 credits won't last long. Maybe there is someone in the bar who could give me a lead."

I guess it's okay for me to interrupt and see if she has something for me."

At first she seemed pretty annoyed that I interrupted her conversation, but after she heard that I was on Freeport, she was a lot nicer. Seems like I could be in luck!

I don’t really know where any of these places are, but she said the mission should be easy. I‘m supposed to hook up with the mission CO King in space above Manhattan. Juni said my ship will be moved to the launch pad. All I have to do is get ready and launch into space."

In any case, this base is incredibly impressive -- the best ships and the best weapons I've ever seen. I’m getting that sinking feeling in my stomach about all of this. Like this is the ride into the sunset the hero makes, or maybe that heroic last stand. In any case, I’m taking up Orillion’s offer and stocking up on all the weapons and equipment I can."

Quintaine called it a Dyson's Sphere. Now we just have to find a way inside. Everyone in this fight owes the Nomads something. Revenge or a cry for freedom. No matter what, we’ve got to win.

Orillion and The Order intend on keeping a close eye on it. They’ve even asked me to be their contact in Liberty. Hakkera has gone back to Kusari to rebuild. Tobias ended up getting kicked out of the Bretonia Royal Space Force just like I thought he would, but I think he got a girlfriend or something out of it. Von Claussen was nowhere to be found after the fight. He’s presumed dead, but somehow I doubt that. A man like Von Claussen doesn’t just fade away. President Jacobi gave Juni, King, and I a full pardon. We even got a medal... the Lone Star. Sounds kind of goofy, doesn't it? Anyway, as much as I appreciate that, it doesn’t make up for the fact that I never got paid. Just my luck... I'm a hero, but I'm back to freelancing. In the end, maybe that's not all that bad. There are still lots of worlds to discover and systems to explore. I don’t think I’m ready to call Liberty home yet. A not insignificant reason for that is that I don’t think I’ll ever get used to Liberty Ale."

If you decide to do some hunting in that area, be careful and stay hidden in the Pittsburg fields as much as possible.

Everybody knows that the Xenos are trying to get in on the Diamond trade -- so far unsuccessfully. The case was no different this time when four Xenos attacked Unioners heading through the Wrangell Field towards Dawson to do some Diamond trading. Rogue pilots held back and watched as the Xenos got torn apart by the more experienced Unioner pilots."

Once the cargo is acquired, Rogue smugglers make their way back to New York, where the goods are fenced to the Junkers at excellent prices.

If successful, Corsairs would never have to worry about the Food shortages that have plagued our people for the 800 years since we were cast upon Crete. In recent years famine has not been a major issue for the Corsairs due to the wealth brought in from the Artifact trade and piracy.

There is concern that they allow Bounty Hunters to come too close to the home world. It has also been argued that the biodomes in Freeport 9 could be salvaged after the Zoner expulsion and used to grow food solely for Corsairs.
